I am a doctoral researcher in the Deep Learning Lab at [West Virginia University](https://wvu.edu), working with [Prof. Nasser Nasrabadi](https://nassernasrabadi.faculty.wvu.edu/). My current research focuses on developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms for applications in computer vision and biometrics. I have over 7 years of research experience and more than 2 years of teaching experience. I have published 14+ papers in renowned international computer vision and biometrics conferences such as WACV, IJCB, and BIOSIG. Additionally, I have journal publications in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, as well as IET Biometrics, among others.

Prior to joining WVU, I served as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at [Manarat International University]((https://manarat.ac.bd)). I completed my M.Sc. at [IICT](https://iict.buet.ac.bd/) from [Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)](https://buet.ac.bd/), under the guidance of [Prof. Hossen Asiful Mustafa](https://hossenmustafa.buet.ac.bd). I obtained my B.Sc. at the department of [EEE](https://www.kuet.ac.bd/department/EEE/) from [Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET)](https://www.kuet.ac.bd) under the supervision of [Dr. Mohiuddin Ahmad](http://www.kuet.ac.bd/eee/ahmad).
