I am a Ph.D. researcher in the Deep Learning Lab at [West Virginia University](https://wvu.edu), under the guidance of [Prof. Nasser Nasrabadi](https://nassernasrabadi.faculty.wvu.edu/). My research focuses on developing advanced machine learning algorithms for applications in computer vision and biometrics. With over seven years of research experience, I specialize in areas including multimodal foundation models, facial representation learning, cross-modal face recognition, face retrieval, and continual learning. My work has been published in esteemed venues such as 2 x WACV, TBIOM, TAES, and IJCB.
